\section{Coulomb interaction}
\label{sec:coulomb_treatment}
Unlike the Skyrme interaction, the Coulomb force is not local, giving rise to an unwanted integral operator in the Hamiltonian.
A well known and widely used device is the Slater approximation \cite{SlaterApp}, which gives a local exchange interaction.
\\In this approximation, the Coulomb energy reads
\begin{align*}
    E_\text{Coul} = \int \mathcal E_\text{Coul}(\mathbf r) d\bm r
    \\\mathcal E_\text{Coul}(\bm r) = \frac{e^2}{2}\bigg[\int  \frac{\rho_p(\mathbf r )\rho_p(\mathbf r ' )}{|\mathbf r-\mathbf r'|}d\mathbf r'  - \frac 3 2 \bigg(\frac 3 \pi \bigg) ^{\frac 1 3}\rho_p^{4/3}(\mathbf r)\bigg]
\end{align*}
Which gives
\begin{equation}
    U_{C}(\mathbf r) = \fdv{\mathcal E_\text{Coul}}{\rho_p} = \frac{e^2}{2}\bigg[\int \frac{\rho_p(\mathbf r ')}{|\mathbf r-\mathbf r'|} d^3 \mathbf r' - 2\bigg(\frac 3 \pi \bigg) ^{\frac 1 3} \rho_p^{1/3}(\mathbf r ) \bigg]
\end{equation}
From a computational standpoint, the exchange part is trivial, while the direct one is more involved.
One could compute the integral, but the complexity on a 3D mesh is $\mathcal O(N^6)$, rendering it unusable for fine meshes.
\\An alternative approach is to solve the poisson equation (from now on, $V_c$ refers to the direct part only)
\begin{equation}
    \label{eq:poisson}
    \nabla^2 V_c = 4\pi e^2 \rho_p
\end{equation}
Given the proton density, we can impose Dirichlet boundary conditions, which can be extracted from a quadrupole expansion of the charge density \cite{Jackson1998}
\begin{equation}
V_c (\mathbf r) = 4\pi e^2 \sum_{\lambda=0}^2\sum_{\mu=-\lambda}^\lambda \frac{\expval{Q_{\lambda\mu}} Y_{\lambda\mu}}{r^{1+\lambda}}\text{ on }\partial \Omega
\end{equation}
Where $\expval{Q_{\lambda\mu}}$ is defined as 
\begin{equation}
    \expval{Q_{\lambda\mu}} = \int r^\lambda Y_{\lambda\mu}^* (\mathbf r)\rho_p(\mathbf r ) d^3 \mathbf r
\end{equation}
Since we expect a charge density confined to the nuclear shape, higher order terms in the expansion can be neglected, provided that the box is sufficiently large.
\\In a reference frame where the nucleus center of mass is at the origin, the expansion reduces to
\begin{equation}
    V_{c}(\mathbf r ) = \frac{Ze^2}{r} + e^2\sum_{\mu=-2}^{2}\frac{\expval{Q_{2\mu}}Y_{2\mu}}{r^3} \text{ on } \partial \Omega
\end{equation}
Refer to appendix \ref{sec:spherical_harmonics} for the definition and numerical evaluation of the spherical harmonics $Y_{\lambda\mu}$.
