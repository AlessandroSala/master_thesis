\section{Hartree-Fock theory}
An empirical description of nuclear structure can be carried out using phenomenological models, as reported in section (REF).
\\A more rigorous approach needs to take into account the fact that the mean field which the nucleons interact with, is generated by the nucleons themselves, due to some microscopic interaction.
Starting from the many-body hamiltonian of the system, we will be able to extract a single particle hamiltonian, where the nucleon is subject to a mean field potential generated by the effective microscopic force.
\\The many-body hamiltonian of the system, made of $A$ fermions, given by
\begin{equation}
    \label{eq:mb_hamiltonian}
    \hat H = \hat T + \hat V = \sum_i -\frac{\hbar^2}{2m}\nabla^2_i + \sum_{i<j} v^{(2)}_{ij} + \sum_{i<j<k} v^{(3)}_{ijk }+\ldots
\end{equation}
With the Schr\"odinger equation of the many-body system given by
\begin{equation}
    \label{eq:many_body_schrodinger}
    \hat H \Psi = E\Psi.
\end{equation}
\subsection{Variational principle}
Since $\hat H$ is a many body operator, finding its eigenstates would be a rather challenging task. To our aid, comes the variational principle, from which we can show that equation \ref{eq:many_body_schrodinger} is equivalent to 
\begin{equation}
    \label{eq:variational_Psi}
    \delta E[\Psi] = \delta \frac{\bra{\Psi} E \ket{\Psi}}{\bra{\Psi}\ket{\Psi}} = 0.
\end{equation}
The variation \ref{eq:variational_Psi} can be obtained from an arbitrary variation of $\Psi$, which can be done indipendently on $\bra{\Psi}$ and $\ket{\Psi}$, since $\Psi$ is complex, yielding
\begin{equation}
    \label{eq:variational_Psi2}
    \bra{\delta \Psi} \hat H  -E\ket{\Psi} + \bra{\Psi} \hat H-E \ket{\delta \Psi} = 0
\end{equation}
since the variation is arbitrary, we can multiply by a phase factor $\ket{\delta \Psi}\mapsto i\ket{\delta \Psi}$ and get
\begin{equation}
    \label{eq:variational_Psi3}
    -i\bra{\delta \Psi} \hat H-E \ket{\Psi} + i\bra{\Psi} \hat H-E \ket{\delta \Psi} = 0.
\end{equation}
Combining equations \ref{eq:variational_Psi2} and \ref{eq:variational_Psi3}, we get
\begin{equation}
    \label{eq:var_eq_res}
    \bra{\delta \Psi} \hat H-E \ket{\Psi} = 0.
\end{equation}
Again, since the variation is arbitrary, equation \ref{eq:var_eq_res} satisfies equation \ref{eq:many_body_schrodinger}.
\subsubsection{Ground state}
Since we always restrict ourselves to a certain subspace of the full Hilbert space, we can only find an approximate solution to the eigenvalue problem. Expanding this solution on the complete set of exact eigenstates of $\hat H$, we have
\begin{equation}
    \label{eq:expansion_gs}
    \ket\Psi = \sum_n a_n \ket{\Psi_n}    
\end{equation}
the total energy amounts to 
\begin{equation}
    \label{eq:ground_state_min}
    E[\Psi] = \frac{\sum_{nn'}\bra {a_{n'}\Psi_{n'}}\hat H \ket{a_n \Psi_n}}{\sum_{nn'}\bra{a_{n'}\Psi_{n'}}\ket{a_n\Psi_{n}}} = \frac{\sum_{n}E_n|a_n|^2}{\sum_n|a_n|^2}\ge \frac{\sum_{n}E_0|a_n|^2}{\sum_n|a_n|^2}\ge E_0.
\end{equation}
where the orthonormality $\bra{\Psi_{n'}\ket{\Psi_n}}=\delta_{nn'}$ has been used. Equation \ref{eq:ground_state_min} tells us that the minimum of the variational subspace we are considering is bound from below by the true ground state energy.
\subsection{Hartree-Fock equations}
The Hartree-Fock method is the application of the variational principle \ref{eq:var_eq_res} to a many-body wavefunction represented by a Slater determinant, which reads
\begin{equation}
    \label{eq:slater_formula}
    \Psi = \frac{1}{\sqrt {A!}} \sum_{\{p\}} (-1)^{p}  \varphi_{p(1)}(\bm r_1)\ldots \varphi_{p(A)}(\bm r_A)
\end{equation}
where $\varphi_i$ are single-particle states.
The slater determinant sums over all possible permutations of the $A$ fermions on the single particle states, with a $-$ sign according to the parity of the permutation.
The Slater determinant is just the assumption of independent single-particle fermion states, so that the Pauli exclusion principle is not violated.
\\To ensure the orthonormality of the single-particle states, we need to add a Lagrange multiplier to the variation of $E$, which ends up reading
\begin{equation}
    \label{eq:fdv_hf}
\delta \bigg(E[\Psi] - \sum_i\lambda_i \int \varphi_i^*\varphi_i d\bm r \bigg) = 0
\end{equation}
We can explicit $E[\Psi] = \bra{\Psi} \hat T + \hat V\ket \Psi$, which can be expressed using the single-particle states 
\begin{align}
    \label{eq:exp_T_V}
    \bra\Psi\hat T\ket \Psi &= \sum_i^A -\frac{\hbar^2}{2m}\int \varphi_i^*(\bm r) \nabla^2 \varphi_i(\bm r) d\bm r\\
    \bra\Psi\hat V\ket \Psi &= \frac 1 2 \sum_{ij}\int\varphi_i^*(\bm r) \varphi_j^*(\bm r') v_{ij}(\bm r, \bm r')\varphi_i(\bm r)\varphi_j(\bm r') d\bm r d\bm r'\\
    &- \frac 1 2 \sum_{ij}\int \varphi_i^*(\bm r) \varphi_j^*(\bm r') v_{ij}(\bm r, \bm r')\varphi_i(\bm r')\varphi_j(\bm r) d\bm r d\bm r'
\end{align}
If we use $\varphi_i^*(\bm r)$ as the quantity to be varied for equation \ref{eq:fdv_hf}, we get the \textit{Hartree-Fock equations}
\begin{align}
    \label{eq:hf_equations}
    &-\frac{\hbar^2}{2m} \nabla^2 \varphi_i\\
    &+ \sum_{j}^A \int \varphi_j^* (\mathbf r') 
        v_{ij}(\mathbf r, \mathbf r')\, 
        \varphi_j (\mathbf r')\, 
        \varphi_i (\mathbf r)\, d\mathbf r'\label{eq:hartree} \\
    &- \sum_{j}^A \int \varphi_j^* (\mathbf r')\, 
        v_{ij}(\mathbf r, \mathbf r')\,
        \varphi_j (\mathbf r)\,
        \varphi_i (\mathbf r')\, d\mathbf r'\label{eq:fock}
        = \varepsilon_i \varphi_i
\end{align}
here the Lagrange multipliers $\lambda_i$ have been replaced by $\varepsilon_i$, since they can be interpreted as the energy of the single-particle states.\\
Now, a couple of observations are in order.
\paragraph{Exchange interaction}
The interaction term \ref{eq:hartree}, called Hartree term, arises from considering independent particles, and is also routinely found in classical physics. The other one in \ref{eq:fock}, called Fock term, or exchange term, takes the form of an integral operator and is given by the quantum mechanical nature of the problem.
\\For what concerns the solution of equation \ref{eq:hf_equations}, the Fock term is very problematic, and is avoided using finite-range interaction like the Gogny force \cite{Robledo_2019}, or contact forces like the Skyrme one \cite{SKYRME1958615}, which is used in the present work, since they render the exchange term as a local one.
\paragraph{Self-consistent solution}
Even if the interaction terms are local, the equation is still highly non-linear, since the mean field potential will be a function of the eigenfunctions themselves. The consequece is that the solution will be found \textit{self-consistently}, that is, by solving for the set of eigenfunctions $\{\varphi_i\}$, using them to build the new mean field, and solving again, repeating the process until convergence.
\subsection{Symmetries}
Since the objective of this work is to solve the Hartree-Fock equations without spatial symmetry assumptions, it is useful to first understand how symmetries propagate along the self-consistent calculation.
\\We start by defining the creation and annihilation operators of the single particle hamiltonian eigenstates, $a_i^\dagger, a_i$, which abide the usual anticommutation relations of fermions
\begin{equation}
    \label{eq:fermion_anticommutations}
    \{a_i, a_j^\dagger\} = \delta_{ij}
\end{equation}
If we expand on a different, orthonormal complete basis $\{\chi_l\}$, we can write the corresponding creation and annihilation operators $c_l^\dagger, c_l$ as
\begin{align}
    \label{eq:basis_change}
    \varphi_k = \sum_l D_{lk} \chi_l\\
    a_k^\dagger = \sum_l D_{lk} c_l^\dagger\\
    a_k = \sum_l D_{lk}^\dagger c_l
\end{align}
Since orthonormality is guaranteed for both sets, taking 
\begin{equation}
    \delta_{jk} = \bra{\varphi_j}\ket{\varphi_k} = \sum_{ll'} D_{l'j}^\dagger D_{lk}\bra{\chi_l}\ket{\chi_l'}\implies DD^\dagger = 1.
\end{equation}
We can define the density matrix as
\begin{equation}
    \label{eq:density_op}
    \rho_{ll'} = \bra{\Psi}c_{l'}^\dagger c_l\ket{\Psi}
\end{equation}
which in the hartree fock basis, using relations \ref{eq:basis_change}, is diagonal and its trace is equal to the particle number $A$.
\\Writing the many body hamiltonian \ref{eq:many_body_schrodinger} in the arbitrary basis of second quantization operators $c_l^\dagger, c_l$, we get
\begin{equation}
    \label{eq:mb_hamiltonian_sq}
    \hat H = \sum_{l_1 l_2}t_{l_1l_2} c_{l_1}^\dagger c_{l_2} + \frac 1 4 \sum_{l_1 l_2 l_3 l_4}\overline{v}_{l_1l_2l_3l_4} c_{l_1}^\dagger c_{l_2}^\dagger c_{l_3} c_{l_4}
\end{equation}
where $t_{l_1l_2}$ and $\overline{v}_{l_1 l_2 l_3 l_4}$ are defined as 
\begin{align}
    \label{eq:t_op}
    t_{l_1l_2} &= \bra{-}c_{l_1}c_{l_2} t c_{l_1}^\dagger c_{l_2}^\dagger \ket{-} = \bra{l_1 l_2}t\ket{l_1 l_2}
    \\ \overline{v}_{l_1 l_2 l_3 l_4} &= \bra{l_1 l_2 l_3 l_4} v \ket{l_1 l_2 l_3 l_4} - \bra{l_1 l_2 l_4 l_3} v \ket{l_1 l_2 l_4 l_3}
\end{align}
The minimization \ref{eq:fdv_hf} can be restated as the variation of $\bra{\Psi}\hat H \ket{\Psi}$, with respect to the density matrix $\rho_{ll'}$, which yields the single particle hamiltonian $h$
\begin{equation}
    \label{eq:spe_scnd}
    h_{ll'} = \pdv{E[\rho]}{\rho_{ll'}} = t + \sum_{kk'}\overline{v}_{lk'l'k}\rho_{kk'} = t+\Gamma_{ll'}.
\end{equation}
Being $h$ diagonal in the Hartree-Fock basis, the self-consistent solution is the one for which
\begin{equation}
    [h, \rho] = 0
\end{equation}
holds.
\subsubsection{Symmetry propagation}
Suppose to start a Hartree-Fock calculation with an initial guess $\ket{\Psi}^{(0)}$ for which the corresponding density matrix is symmetric under the action of a many-body symmetry operator $S$ which commutes with the Hamiltonian
\begin{equation}
    \label{eq:comm_S_H}
    [S, \hat H] = 0.
\end{equation}
It can be shown \cite{ring2004nuclear} that 
\begin{equation}
    \label{eq:comm_S_Gamma}
    S\Gamma[\rho] S^\dagger  = \Gamma[S\rho S^\dagger].
\end{equation}
The single particle Hamiltonian $h$ will then display the same property
\begin{equation}
    \label{eq:comm_h_S}
    S h[\rho] S^\dagger = h[S\rho S^\dagger]
\end{equation}
meaning that $h$ will be symmetric under the action of $S$, as well as the next iteration's density matrix $\rho^{(1)}$. The symmetry $S$ gets propagated self-consistently until the minimum is found.
\\This has profound numerical implications, since the real minimum of deformed nuclei can be found only starting from starting guesses with similar broken symmetries. It can be the case that numerical noise allows to explore the full energy surface, but if one has to take into consideration the numerical cost of a bad guess, then it's still advantageous to start from a good one.
\subsection{Density Functional Theory}
It shall be evident shortly, in section \ref{sec:skyrme}, that a more general approach to microscopic models has to be taken, in order to give a satisfactory description of the nuclear world.
\\The framework that we'll briefly outline here is called Density Functional Theory (DFT). DFT was introduced by P. Hohenberg and W. Kohn in 1964 \cite{HK}, by proving two theorems.
\\The \textbf{first} HK theorem states that the energy of a fermion system, subject to an external potential $V_\text{ext}$ can be expressed solely as a functional of the particle density $\rho$ of the system.
\begin{equation}
    \label{eq:hk_theorem1}
    E[\rho] = F[\rho] + \int V_\text{ext} \rho(\bm r) d\mathbf r
\end{equation}
While the \textbf{second} one states that the ground state of the system is found by minimizing its variation with respect to $\rho$. 
\\HK theorems are fundamental but not constructive \cite{NDFT}, since they do not provide a form for the functional $F$, which is intrinsic to the physics of the fermions at hand.
