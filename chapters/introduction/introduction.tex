\chapter{Introcution to nuclear structure and phenomenology}
In this chapter, a concise introduction to nuclear physics is provided, as a way to understand important physical properties of the system under study.
First, in section \ref{sec:phenomenology}, we will discuss the main empirical facts about nuclides, such as particle density distribuion and binding energies. Then, we will address in section \ref{sec:models} simple phenomenological models historically employed to describe them, to move on to more advanced topics, that are able to complete the description of nuclear structure, which are nuclear pairing in section \ref{sec:pairing_intro} and nuclear deformations in section \ref{sec:deformations}.
Finally, in section \ref{sec:fission}, we will see an overview of the nuclear fission process, for which exotic deformations are necessary for a complete description of the phenomena.
