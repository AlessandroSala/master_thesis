\chapter{Nuclear structure and deformations}
In this chapter, a concise introduction to nuclear physics is provided, as a way to understand the essential physical properties of the system under study.
First, in section \ref{sec:models}, we will review the main empirical facts about nuclides, such as particle density distribuion and binding energies and the  simple phenomenological models historically employed to describe them. Moving on to more advanced topics, that are able to complete the general description of nuclear structure, which are nuclear pairing in section \ref{sec:pairing_intro} and nuclear deformations in section \ref{sec:deformations}.
\\Lastly, in section \ref{sec:fission}, we will overview the nuclear fission process, by deriving a simple model to describe it and discussing the importance of exotic deformations to accurately describe it.
