\chapter{Numerical methods}
This chapter is devoted to describing the practical implementation of the nuclear Hartree-Fock method of this work. In section \ref{sec:finite_diff}, the two partial differential equations (PDEs) of interest, the Kohn-Sham equation and the Poisson equation, are numerically approximated through finite differences. In section \ref{sec:eigensolvers}, a breakdown of numerical solvers for the large-scale eigenvalue problem posed by the KS equation is presented, to didactically illustrate the reason and implementation of the GCG algorithm. Finally, in section \ref{sec:minimization}, the self-consistent calculation is presented, along with the implementation of spatial constraints and the optimization of the numerical parameters of GCG.
