\chapter{Numerical methods}
\label{chap:numerical}
This chapter is devoted to describing the practical implementation of the nuclear Hartree--Fock method of this work. In Section~\ref{sec:finite_diff}, the two partial differential equations (PDEs) of interest, the Kohn--Sham equation and the Poisson equation, are numerically approximated through finite differences. In Section~\ref{sec:eigenvalue_problem}, a breakdown of numerical solvers for the large-scale eigenvalue problem posed by the KS equation is presented, to pedagogically illustrate the rationale and implementation of the GCG algorithm. Finally, in Section~\ref{sec:minimisation}, the self-consistent calculation is presented, along with the implementation of spatial constraints and the optimisation of the numerical parameters of GCG.
