\chapter{Numerical methods}
This chapter is devoted to describing the practical implementation of the nuclear Hartree-Fock method of this work, with a focus on the discretized evaluation of the relevant partial differential equations (PDEs), the approximate solution of the eigenvalue problem, and the solution of the self-consistent problem.
