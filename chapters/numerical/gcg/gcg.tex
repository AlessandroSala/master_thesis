\section{Conjugate gradient methods}
This section is devoted to exploring the idea behind the Conjugate Gradient (CG) algorithm and its use in the General Conjugate Gradient (GCG).
\subsection{Conjugate Gradient}
The CG method is used for solving linear systems of the form
\begin{equation}
    \label{eq:lin_sys}
    Ax = b
\end{equation}
Where $A$ is an $n\times n$ matrix, and $x$ and $b$ are $n$-dimensional vectors.
\\The quadratic form $f(x)$ associated to this system  
\begin{equation}
    \label{eq:quad_form}
    f(x) = \frac 1 2 x^T A x - b^T x
\end{equation}
If $A$ is symmetric, positive-definite, the
