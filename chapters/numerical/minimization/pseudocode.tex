\subsection{Details on the implementation of the code}
The whole Hartree-Fock framework presented up to this point, has been implemented using the C++ language \cite{stroustrup1986overview} and the Eigen linear algebra library \cite{eigenweb}, which implements linear algebra operatrions through low level routines such as $\texttt{LAPACK}$ and $\texttt{BLAS}$. In figure \ref{fig:pseudocode}, the schematics of the program structure is reported.
