\section{Code implementation details}
In this last section regarding numerical methods, some important features about the actual code implementation of the HF method are discussed.
Mainly, the implementation of the Augmented Lagrangian Method to enforce spatial constraints on the HF solution, the pseudocode of the entire self-consistent procedure, and the choice of optimal parameters for the functional minimization.
