\chapter{Results for spherical nuclei}
In this chapter, results for spherical nuclei are presented. These are mostly calculated for double magic nuclei, with the exception of $^{90}$Zr.
The reason behind choosing spherical nuclei as an initial benchmark, is that numerous spherical HF codes are available and they have the advantage of being one-dimensional, which allows the use of very fine meshes, with a step size that can go down to the physical scale of the problem, which is roughly 0.1 fm in this case, without any major computational limit. We can use these codes as a reference ideal value for the different quantities produced by our code. The choice for benchmarking spherical results in the present work has been the \texttt{hfbcs\_qrpa} code \cite{hfbcsqrpa}.
