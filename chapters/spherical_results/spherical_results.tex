\chapter{Results for spherical nuclei}
\label{chap:res_sph}
In this chapter, results for spherical nuclei are presented. These are calculated for doubly magic nuclei, with the exception of $^{90}$Zr, since a pairing interaction is not implemented in the present work.
The reason behind choosing spherical nuclei as an initial benchmark is that spherical codes have the advantage of assuming quantities to be dependent only on the radial coordinate, ie they are 1D. The low dimensionality allows the use of very fine meshes, with a step size that can go down to the order of $\sim 0.1$ fm, without significant computational overhead. We can use these codes as a reference ideal value for the different quantities produced by our code in the case of spherical nuclei. The choice for benchmarking spherical results in the present work has been the \texttt{hfbcs\_qrpa} code \cite{hfbcsqrpa}.

This chapter is organised as follows. Section \ref{sec:physical_quantities} introduces the evaluation of mean-square radii used to numerically validate the code. Section \ref{sec:hfbcs} introduces the calculation parameters, section \ref{sec:oxygen} presents benchmark results for $^{16}$O, and section \ref{sec:heavier} extends the analysis to the heavier nuclei $^{48}$Ca, $^{56}$Ni, and $^{90}$Zr.
