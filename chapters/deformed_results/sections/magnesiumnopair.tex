\section{$^{24}$Mg}
In the following section, results for $^{24}$Mg are presented, it's a natural choice to study how well deformations are represented by our framework, since it's light, very deformed and shows no pairing interaction in its ground state.
\subsection{\texttt{HFBTHO} code and calculation details}
\subsubsection{\texttt{HFBTHO}}
To benchmark the code in the case of nuclear deformation, the \texttt{HFBTHO} code was used \cite{MAREVIC2022108367}, it's a HFB code which minimizes the energy functional on a (Transformed) Harmonic Oscillator basis. Since $^{24}$Mg is a light nucleus, it still works well in this case.
\\All calculations are carried out using a number of shells of $12$ and a null pairing interaction. Default paramters for the quadrupole constraints were used.
\subsubsection{Code parameters and axial constraint}
As for our code, calculations are performed on a box $[-10, 10]$ fm.
In the case of the ground state calculation, a step size of $0.33$ fm is used, with a starting guess of a deformed Woods-Saxon with $\beta_2=0.4$.
\\The calculation in the case of the deformation curve is carried out imposing the following constraints
\begin{align}
  \expval{\Re\mathcal Q_{22}} = 0
  \\\expval{\Im \mathcal Q_{22}} = 0
  \\\expval{\mathcal Q_{20}} = q_{20}.
\end{align}
These constraints altogether impose an axial deformation on the system. This is done because on a full mesh like in our case, the nucleus may deform on a different axis from the chosen one (z), resulting in spurious contributions to the real deformation curve; moreover, the axial symmetry of $\texttt{HFBTHO}$ doesn't allow broken axial symmetry configurations.
\\Regarding the stiffness $c$ and damping parameter $\mu$ of ALM \ref{sec:alm}, $c=0.001$ and $\mu=0.1$ were used. As for convergence criteria, a tolerance of $0.001$ on the value of $\beta_2 - \beta_{2, \text{target}}$ was used.
\subsubsection{Ground state}
Table \ref{tab:mg_table} reports data for the ground state of $^{24}$Mg, compare with $\texttt{HFBTHO}$ results, while figure \ref{fig:mg_gs_density_axial} shows the total particle density.
Charge radii for the two codes are displayed but not compared, due to different formulas used for their computation.

\subsubsection{Deformation curve}
In figure \ref{fig:mg_no_pair_deformation}, the deformation curve is shown for $^{24}$Mg, without pairing. To counteract the sharp rise in CPU time, due to the high number of points in the curve, a coarser grid is used, hence the different minimum energy and $\beta_2$ values than the ones reported in table \ref{tab:mg_table}.
