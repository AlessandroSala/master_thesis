\chapter{Results for deformed nuclei}
\label{chap:res_def}
Having established that the code works as expected for spherical nuclei, we can extend the calculations to deformed systems. In this chapter, the GCG implementation is validated against well-established deformed codes.
In addition, we also present some new original results with a focus on $\alpha$-clustering and nuclei near the drip lines.

This chapter is organised as follows. First, in Section~\ref{sec:beta}, the quadrupole deformation parameter $\beta_2$ is introduced and its two different definitions are compared. In Section~\ref{sec:mg_benchmark}, results for the deformed $^{24}$Mg are presented and used as a benchmark for the performance of our code, first against the HO basis expansion code \texttt{HFBTHO} in Section~\ref{sec:hfbtho}, second against the Cartesian mesh code \texttt{EV8} in Section~\ref{sec:ev8}. 
Finally, in Section~\ref{sec:novel}, original results on other deformed nuclei are discussed, in particular, in Section~\ref{sec:ne20} results regarding an alpha-clustering study in $^{20}$Ne, and in Section~\ref{sec:si42} results for the near-drip line nuclei $^{42}$Si and $^{28}$S.

\section{Deformation parameters}
\label{sec:beta}
When dealing with deformed nuclei, mean square radii are not sufficient to characterise the nuclear density. The main quantity used is the quadrupole deformation parameter $\beta_2$, similar to the one encountered in Section~\ref{sec:deformations}. There is an ambiguity in its definition in literature, where some \cite{MAREVIC2022108367} compute it by using the actual mean square radius of the density
\begin{equation}
    \label{eq:beta_real_radius}
    \beta_2 = \frac{4\pi\expval{\mathcal Q_{2 0}}}{5A\expval{r^2}},
\end{equation}
where $\expval{r^2}$ is the total mean square radius of the nucleus 
\begin{equation}
    \expval{r^2} = \frac{\int (\rho_n + \rho_p )r^2 d\bm r}{\int (\rho_n + \rho_p )d\bm r} = \expval{x^2+y^2+z^2}.
\end{equation}
While others \cite{HilaireGirod2006,Ryssens2015_EV8} normalise the quadrupole moment with respect to the parametetrised nuclear radius in formula \eqref{eq:nuc_radius}, which yields 
\begin{equation}
  \label{eq:beta}
  \beta_{2} = \frac{4\pi\expval{\mathcal Q_{20}}}{3AR^2}
\end{equation}
where the relation 
\begin{equation}
  \expval{r^2} = \frac 3 5 {R}^2
\end{equation}
is used and the value for $r_0$ is taken to be $1.2$ fm.

Using either of the two formulae (\ref{eq:beta_real_radius}, \ref{eq:beta}), because of the normalization with respect to the total radius and mass, the $\beta_2$ parameter allows the comparison of different nuclei across the chart.

In Figure~\ref{fig:beta_compare}, a comparison between the two formulae is presented; as shown by the shape of the curves, it is possible to observe that the normalisation of $\beta_2$ with respect to the real radius has an asymptotic behaviour for large deformations, since for $\expval{z^2}\to \infty$, assuming axial symmetry and constant volume $V$
\begin{equation}
\beta_2 \propto \frac{2z^2-2V/z}{z^2 + 2V/z}\underset{{z\to\infty}}{\to} 2, 
\end{equation}
while normalising with respect to the parametrised radius $R$ has no such asymptotic behaviour, since $R$ is constant for any deformation.

\end{figure}

The choice of $\beta_2$ used in the present work is the one computed with the parametrised radius~\eqref{eq:beta}. To avoid confusion in the reader and present results in a consistent manner, when comparing results with the \texttt{HFBTHO} code, which uses formula \eqref{eq:beta_real_radius}, the bare quadrupole moment $\expval{\mathcal Q_{20}}$ is shown instead.

\subsection{Code parameters and axial constraint}
As for our code, calculations are performed in a box $[-10,+10]$ fm.
In the case of the ground state calculation, a step size of $0.33$ fm is used, with a starting guess of a deformed Woods--Saxon with $\beta_2=0.4$.

The calculation in the case of the deformation curve is carried out imposing the following constraints:
\begin{align}
  \expval{\Re\mathcal Q_{22}} = \expval{\Im \mathcal Q_{22}} = 0,
  \\\expval{x} = \expval{y} = \expval{z} = 0,
  \\\expval{\mathcal Q_{20}} = q_{20}.
\end{align}
These constraints altogether impose an axial deformation on the system, the constraint on $\expval{\mathcal Q_{20}}$ alone is not sufficient because on an unconstrained mesh like in our case, the nucleus may deform on a different axis from the chosen one ($z$) or the $\expval{\mathcal Q_{20}}$ moment may be subject to spurious contributions from a centre of mass not in the origin; moreover, the axial symmetry of $\texttt{HFBTHO}$ doesn't allow broken axial symmetry configurations.

Regarding the stiffness $c$ and damping parameter $\mu$ of the ALM described in Section~\ref{sec:alm}, $c=0.005$ and $\mu=0.02$ were used. As for convergence criteria, a tolerance of $0.001$ on the value of $\beta_2 - \beta_{2, \text{target}}$ was used.
